1.0.0
-----

| After updating to version 1.0.0 please run the update script in Extension Manager (**bevor comparing and deleting the old database table in install-tool!**) to adopt already created PDFs.
|
| If you use the scheduler script of this Extension please check your scheduler. The tasks from older versions could not be adopt. You will have to delete the old tasks and create new ones.
| I'm sorry for this, but there has been no other solution, known to me.
